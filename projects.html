	 <h4><strong>Business Intelligence and Data Governance:</strong> My role on the data team was the Data Analyst. I was responsible for interpreting and analyzing data and implementing ways to show the data. I had to provide information about the company's website visitors. To do this I made dashboards for the other teams to help them interpret data. </h4>
	 <h4><strong>Information Security:</strong> On the InfoSec team I was the Security Incident Response Specialist. Our project was to find and implement a password management system. I went over applications that our System Administrator picked and made sure that they were good to use.</h4>
	 <h4><strong>System Development:</strong>On the System Development team we had to redesign the company's website. I had two roles on the team, the first one was the UI/UX Designer. As a UI/UX Designer I was responsible for usability and visual design of the User Interfaces, and ensuring intuitive/easy-to-use experiences. The first thing I did was make wireframes so our Software Developers could start working on the site. The second job I had was the Quality Assurance Lead. As the Quality Assurance Lead I had to ensure our delivered products and service meet the established standards of quality including reliability, usability, and performance. I spent time trying to find bugs on our website and putting them in a spreadsheet. I needed to pay attention to every little detail and communicate every thing that I found wrong. </h4>
